### Abstract
Under the condition that a warship escapes along a linear direction, the analytic solution of the torpedo tracing trajectory is obtained by solving the corresponding differential equation using the [<span style="color: #40c25e">coordinates rotation transformation</span>]().

### Proposed Mathematical Model
Under the modeled condition, torpedo Pursuit Range [<span style="color: #3ec9c0">S</span>]() can be calculate by the following formular:

where:

- [<span style="color: #c23ec9">k</span>]() denotes the speed of the torpedo is k (k > 1 ) times than the speed of the enemy ship, 
- The launch location of the torpedo is exactly [<span style="color: #c93e3e">a</span>]() nautical miles due west of the enemy ship.
- The enemy ship escape with a constant speed [<span style="color: #c2ae40">v</span>]() knots/min along a straight path.
- The escape direction of the enemy ship is at an angle of [<span style="color: #405cc2">Î¸</span>]() with the x-axis.
