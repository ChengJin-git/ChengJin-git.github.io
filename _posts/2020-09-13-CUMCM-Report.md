### Abstract
In this paper, we analyze the mechanism of the heat transfer process in the center of the soldering area, and establish a model of the temperature variation of the center of the soldering area with time, with the goal of optimizing the furnace temperature profile and the process limits as constraints. By setting the temperature of the small temperature zone of the reflow furnace and the conveyor belt over the furnace speed search solution to meet the process limits and meet the requirements of the ideal furnace temperature curve, and finally determine the temperature of each temperature zone of the reflow furnace and the conveyor belt over the furnace speed.
#### Validation of the Proposed Model
According to the initial problem below,
