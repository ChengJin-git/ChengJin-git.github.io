### Abstract
Resoldering ovens are important devices in surface mount technology (SMT). In this paper, the heat transfer process in the center of the soldering zone is mechanically analyzed.
In this paper, we analyze the mechanism of the heat transfer process in the center of the soldering area, and establish a model of the temperature variation of the center of the soldering area with time, with the goal of optimizing the furnace temperature profile and the process limits as constraints. By setting the temperature of the small temperature zone of the reflow furnace and the conveyor belt over the furnace speed search solution to meet the process limits and meet the requirements of the ideal furnace temperature curve, and finally determine the temperature of each temperature zone of the reflow furnace and the conveyor belt over the furnace speed.
By specifying the temperature settings to draw the furnace temperature curve, this paper considers the relationship between the center of the welding area and the location of the small temperature zone, which is located within the small temperature zone and the gap between adjacent small temperature zones. First of all, the main consideration in the small temperature zone hot air, the furnace wall and the welding area of heat convection and heat radiation, and heat radiation into equivalent heat convection; secondly, the adjacent temperature zone to the gap air heat transfer. The relationship between the two positions to establish the center of the welding region temperature - time of the ordinary differential equation model. When solving, the temperature-time relationship of the center of the accessory welding area is fitted to the size of the convective heat transfer coefficient in the furnace temperature curve model. Finally, the furnace temperature curve is plotted under the new temperature and conveyor belt speed conditions. This results in temperatures of 129.45°C, 168.10°C, 189.60°C and 224.98°C at the midpoint of small temperature zones 3, 6 and 7 and at the end of small temperature zone 8, respectively, under the new set conditions.
Under the set parameters of the reflow furnace, this paper based on the model of the temperature variation law of the center of the welding area with time, in order to solve the maximum allowable transmission over the furnace speed, this paper to the conveyor belt speed as the optimization variable, because the length of the conveyor belt is fixed and known to be 435.5 cm, by the known process limits, the conveyor belt speed can only be 65-100 cm/min From the speed values of 67-80 cm/min, we obtained the maximum overheating speed of 80 cm/min.
In order to minimize the area covered by the ideal furnace temperature curve over 217°C to the peak temperature, and to combine with the condition that the temperature set for each small temperature zone can only be adjusted within ±10°C of the original experimental set temperature, we added the target temperature of the small temperature zone as a constraint based on the process limit and the range limit of the conveyor belt speed, and after optimization, the temperature of each temperature zone was determined to be After optimization, the temperature of each temperature zone and the speed of the conveyor belt were set to 185°C for small temperature zone 1-5, 186°C for small temperature zone 6, 238°C for small temperature zone 7, 265°C for small temperature zone 8-9, and the speed of the furnace was set to 98 cm/min, which met the minimum area condition and reached 668.8741.
In order to obtain a more ideal furnace temperature curve, it is necessary to satisfy the symmetry with the peak temperature as the centerline as much as possible. By establishing the index value for measuring the asymmetry of the curve and converting the single-objective planning to multi-objective optimization model on the basis of the previous step to minimize the index value of the asymmetry, a further ideal furnace temperature curve is finally obtained with a minimum index value of 218.7779 for the asymmetry and more thanThe minimum value of the asymmetry index is 218.7779, and the area covered by the temperature from 217°C to the peak temperature is 668.9811. The optimum temperature and belt speed for each temperature zone are set to 185°C for small temperature zone 1-5, 192°C for small temperature zone 6, 235°C for small temperature zone 7, and 265°C for small temperature zone 8-9.  The speed of overheating was set to 98 cm/min.
In summary, this paper analyzes the temperature variation law in the center of the welding area, and obtains the furnace temperature curve model based on the heat convection heat transfer method to meet the process boundaries, and the actual curve is in good agreement with the generalization.
